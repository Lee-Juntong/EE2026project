# EE2026project
this is the final project we have done in EE2026, using BASYS 3    
This project is done by @zikunz and @Lee-Juntong  
To Test, download everything, open SoundDisplay.xpr with Vivado (we used version 2018.2)  
After doing so, connect BASYS 3 (with FPGA and sound detector) to computer, program it.  
Overall, the output are displayed on the 7-segs, LEDs, and FPGA screen, with the input in the form of switches, buttons and sound.  
Read the report for more details regarding this project.
